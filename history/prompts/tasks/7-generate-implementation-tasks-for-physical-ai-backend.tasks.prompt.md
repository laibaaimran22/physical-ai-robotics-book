# Generate Implementation Tasks for Physical AI Backend

## User Input
```
create it accordingly but best way
```

## Response Summary
Successfully generated comprehensive implementation tasks for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book platform backend. Created tasks.md with 83 sequential tasks organized across 8 phases:

Phase 1: Project Setup (T001-T005)
Phase 2: Foundational Components (T006-T013)
Phase 3: [US1] Document Ingestion System (T014-T032)
Phase 4: [US2] RAG Chatbot System (T033-T042)
Phase 5: [US3] User Management (Optional Features) (T043-T058)
Phase 6: [US4] Content Management (T059-T066)
Phase 7: [US5] API Resource Management (T067-T071)
Phase 8: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns (T072-T083)

Tasks follow required checklist format with sequential IDs, user story labels, parallel execution markers, and specific file paths. MVP scope defined focusing on core RAG functionality without authentication initially. All tasks are specific enough for LLM implementation.

## Outcome
Complete implementation roadmap with 83 tasks ready for execution. Each task follows checklist format and includes specific file paths. MVP scope clearly defined for rapid delivery of core functionality.
